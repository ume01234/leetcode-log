## ✔︎ Problem Summary
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

## ✔︎ My Thinking
- At first, I thought of a brute-force approach using two loops.
- But that would take O(n^2) time, which is inefficient.
- Then I remembered hash maps are useful for complement checks.
