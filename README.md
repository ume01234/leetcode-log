# LeetCode-log

Self-study log aimed at enhancing coding skills and English proficiency.
This repository documents my daily practice solving LeetCode problems  
as part of my continuous effort to improve algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills,and technical writing in English.

## Repository Structure

For each problem, I include:
- `solution.py`: My final accepted solution. 
- `README.md`: My thought process, failed attempts, and takeaways.  
       - **Date solved, Time spent, Difficulty**  
       - **Problem** – summary in my own words  
       - **My Thinking** – initial approach and reasoning  
       - **Insights from Solution** – what I learned after reviewing the solution/editorial  
       - **Key Points** – lessons learned, patterns, and important reminders

All notes are written in English to practice technical writing.   
My goal is to improve both my algorithm skills and English technical writing.   
Problems are organized as folders with the format: `0001-title-name`.
