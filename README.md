# LeetCode-log

This repository contains my personal learning journey through LeetCode problems.

For each problem, I include:
- `solution.py`: My final accepted solution
- `README.md`: My thought process, failed attempts, and takeaways (all in English)

My goal is to improve both my algorithm skills and English technical writing.

Problems are organized as folders with the format: `0001-title-name`
